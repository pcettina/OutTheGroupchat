### Actual Database: Supabase PostgreSQL
> Note: An earlier version of this document referenced PlanetScale (MySQL). The actual database is Supabase PostgreSQL, connected via Prisma 5.22.0.

### Cost Estimation (Monthly)

| Service | Free Tier | Starter | Growth |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Vercel** (Hosting) | $0 | $20 | $70 |
| **Supabase** (Database) | $0 | $25 | $100 |
| **Upstash** (Redis) | $0 (10k/day) | $10 | $25 |
| **Pusher** (Real-time) | $0 (200k msg) | $49 | $99 |
| **OpenAI** (AI) | Pay-as-go | ~$20 | ~$100 |
| **Sentry** (Errors) | $0 (5k events) | $26 | $80 |
| **Total** | **~$0-20** | **~$150** | **~$474** |

- [x] Rate limiting on ALL endpoints (48/48 — Upstash, 2026-04-14)
- [x] Input validation on all major API routes (Zod)
- [x] SQL injection prevention (Prisma)
- [x] XSS prevention (React handles, plus DOMPurify installed)
- [x] CORS configured (next.config.js, 2026-03-23)

### Completed Security Fixes

- [x] In-memory rate limiting replaced with Upstash Redis

### Post-Beta (Nice to Have)

- [ ] Two-factor authentication
- [ ] OAuth providers (Google, Apple)

## Success Metrics for Beta Launch

### Technical Targets

- [ ] 0 critical bugs in production
- [ ] < 3s page load time (Vercel Analytics)
- [ ] > 99% uptime (BetterStack)
- [ ] Error rate < 1% (Sentry)

### User Targets

- [ ] 20-50 beta users signed up
- [ ] 10+ trips created
- [ ] Survey/voting flows tested end-to-end

## Emergency Procedures

### If Site Goes Down
1. Check Vercel status page
2. Check Supabase status
3. Review Sentry for errors
4. Check BetterStack alerts (once configured)
5. Rollback to previous deployment if needed

### If Database Issues
1. Check Supabase dashboard
2. Verify connection string
3. Check for query timeouts in Sentry
4. Scale connection pool if needed

### If AI Not Working
1. Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is set in Vercel environment
2. Check OpenAI status page
3. Routes return 503 gracefully when key absent (implemented 2026-03-23)
4. Fall back to manual itinerary planning UI
