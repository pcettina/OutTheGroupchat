# 📡 API & Integration Status

> **Last Updated: 2026-04-17**
>
> **Archival:** trip/activity routes moved to `src/app/api/_archive/` as of 2026-04-16 Phase 1. See REFACTOR_PLAN.md. Sections below that reference `/api/trips/*` and `/api/activities/*` reflect the pre-archive state for historical context; authoritative status for these routes is the "📦 Archived Routes" section near the bottom of this file.
>
> **Phase 2 in progress (2026-04-17):** branch `refactor/phase-2-crew-domain` renames scaffolded `Connection` → `Crew`, adds `User.crewLabel`, adds `CheckIn.activeUntil`. Social-domain routes will live under `/api/crew/*` (not `/api/connections/*`). See REFACTOR_PLAN §3.5 for naming rationale.
>
> **Last Audit:** April 2026
> **Live API routes (post-archive):** 35
> **Archived API routes (Phase 1):** 13
> **Target:** 100% for Beta Launch (re-baselined in Phase 8)
> **Sentry Coverage:** 19/48 routes instrumented on pre-archive branch; coverage on new live surface re-computed after Phase 2

| `/api/checkins/[id]` | DELETE | 5 | Cancel check-in |
| `/api/venues/search` | GET | 4 | Venue search (repurposes Places API) |
