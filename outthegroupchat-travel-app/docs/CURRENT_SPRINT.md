## 🔴 PRIORITY 0: Critical Bug Fixes

### Issue #1: Notifications Data Structure Mismatch
**Status:** ✅ Verified Working  
**File:** `src/app/notifications/page.tsx`  
**Impact:** Users see error when viewing notifications

**Problem:**
```typescript
// Frontend expects:
data?.notifications

// API returns:
{ success: true, data: { notifications: [...], unreadCount: 5 } }

// Should access:
data?.data?.notifications
```

**Resolution:** Code inspection revealed the notifications page already correctly accesses `result.data` (line 22) and properly destructures `data?.notifications` and `data?.unreadCount`. No fix was needed.

**Verified:**
- [x] Notifications page correctly accesses data path
- [x] Unread count reference is correct
- [x] Error boundary exists in the component

---

### Issue #2: Comments API - Trip Support Missing
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**File:** `src/app/api/feed/comments/route.ts`  
**Impact:** Users can't comment on trip posts

**Problem:** API only supports `itemType: 'activity'`, but feed has trip items.

**Completed:**
- [x] Add TripComment model to Prisma schema
- [x] Update comments API to handle `itemType: 'trip'`
- [x] Added TRIP_COMMENT notification type
- [x] Run database migration via Supabase SQL Editor (Dec 17)
- [ ] Test comment creation on trips

**Schema Added:**
```prisma
model TripComment {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  tripId    String
  userId    String
  text      String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  trip Trip @relation(fields: [tripId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@index([tripId])
  @@index([userId])
}
```

---

### Issue #3: Reactions API - Trip Support Missing
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**File:** `src/app/api/feed/engagement/route.ts`  
**Impact:** Users can't like trip posts

**Problem:** Uses SavedActivity model, no TripLike model exists.

**Completed:**
- [x] Add TripLike model to Prisma schema
- [x] Update engagement API to use TripLike for trips
- [x] Update like counts in feed API (GET handler)
- [x] Added TRIP_LIKE notification type
- [x] Run database migration via Supabase SQL Editor (Dec 17)

**Schema Added:**
```prisma
model TripLike {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  tripId    String
  userId    String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())

  trip Trip @relation(fields: [tripId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@unique([userId, tripId])
  @@index([tripId])
}
```

### Bugs Found & Fixed 🟢

#### Bug #1: Email Invitations Fail to Send
**Status:** ✅ Fixed (Code) / 🟡 Pending (Config)  
**Impact:** Can't invite users via email
**Root Cause:** 
1. API only checked TripMember, not trip owner ✅ Fixed
2. Resend domain verification needed for production emails
**Manual Fix Needed:** 
- Either verify `outthegroupchat.com` domain in Resend dashboard

- Filter tabs (All, Active, Completed) ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING
- Trip cards display correctly
- Trip creation wizard

### NEW Bugs Found 🔴

#### Bug #6: "Trip not found" Error After Creation
**Status:** 🔴 NEEDS FIX  
**Impact:** HIGH - Users can't view trips they just created
**Symptom:** After creating a trip, clicking on it shows "Trip not found" error, but trip appears in trips list
**Root Cause (Suspected):** 
1. Next.js 15 async params handling - need to await params
2. Possible authorization check issue in GET route
**File:** `src/app/api/trips/[tripId]/route.ts`

#### Bug #7: AI Chat Assistant Error
**Status:** 🔴 NEEDS FIX  
**Impact:** MEDIUM - AI chat is unusable
**Symptom:** "Sorry, I encountered an error. Please try again!" message
**Root Cause (Possible):**
1. `OPENAI_API_KEY` not properly set or invalid
2. Rate limiting issues
3. Streaming response handling
**File:** `src/app/api/ai/chat/route.ts`

#### Bug #8: Email Invitations Still Not Working  
**Status:** 🟡 CONFIG ISSUE  
**Impact:** HIGH - Can't invite users
**Symptom:** Emails still not delivered
**Root Cause:** 
- `EMAIL_FROM=noreply@outthegroupchat.com` but domain not verified in Resend
**Fix:** Set `EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev` in Vercel for testing

#### Feature Request #1: "Inviting" Filter Tab
**Status:** 🟡 ENHANCEMENT  
**Impact:** LOW - UX improvement
**Request:** Add "Inviting" tab to filter trips with `INVITING` status
**File:** `src/components/trips/TripList.tsx`

---

## 🐛 Production Testing Round 3 (Dec 17, 2025 - Evening)

### What Works ✅
- Email delivery confirmed (emails arrive, but go to spam folder) ✅
- Primary color system fixed - all buttons now visible ✅
- AI chat error handling improved ✅

### NEW Bugs Found & Fixed 🔴

#### Bug #9: Add Activity Modal Visibility Issue
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Impact:** HIGH - Users can't see the activity creation modal  
**Symptom:** Modal appears at bottom of screen or is not visible when "Add Activity" button is clicked  
**Root Cause:** 
- Z-index conflict with other UI elements
- Modal may have been rendered in a container with lower stacking context
- Backdrop and modal z-index not high enough to appear above all content

**Fix Applied:**
- Increased backdrop z-index from `z-50` to `z-[9998]`
- Increased modal z-index from `z-50` to `z-[9999]`
- Added `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}` to prevent backdrop clicks from closing modal
- Modal already correctly positioned with `fixed left-1/2 top-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/trips/AddActivityModal.tsx`

**Verification:**
- Modal now appears centered on screen
- Visible above all other content
- Works on both desktop and mobile (responsive with `max-h-[90vh]`)

---

#### Bug #10: Invitation Acceptance Flow Failing
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Impact:** HIGH - Users can't join trips after creating account via invitation link  
**Symptom:** User receives email, creates account, but is not added to trip. Invitation shows as "pending" but user can't access trip.  
**Root Cause:** 
- Signup API creates `TripInvitation` with status `PENDING` but doesn't auto-accept
- User is redirected to trip page but isn't a member yet
- No automatic acceptance logic when signing up via invitation link
- User must manually find and accept invitation (poor UX)

**Fix Applied:**
1. **Auto-accept logic in signup flow:**
   - After successful signup and sign-in, check if user came from invitation link
   - Extract `tripId` from redirect URL (`/trips/[tripId]`)
   - Fetch user's pending invitations
   - Find matching invitation for the trip
   - Auto-accept invitation via API call to `/api/invitations/[invitationId]`
   - User is immediately added as trip member

2. **Error handling:**
   - If auto-accept fails, user is still redirected (graceful degradation)
   - Logs errors for debugging without blocking signup flow

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx`

**Flow:**
```
User clicks invitation link → Signup page (with redirect param)
  ↓
User creates account → Signup API creates TripInvitation (PENDING)
  ↓
Auto sign-in → Fetch pending invitations
  ↓
Find matching invitation → Auto-accept via API
  ↓
User added as trip member → Redirect to trip page
```

**Verification:**
- User can now join trip immediately after signup
- No manual acceptance step required
- Works for both email invitations and direct links

---

#### Bug #11: Likes Not Persisting Between Sessions
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Impact:** MEDIUM - User engagement data lost on page refresh  
**Symptom:** Likes appear to work when clicked, but disappear after page refresh or when switching accounts. Like counts don't persist.  
**Root Cause:** 
- `EngagementBar` component only used `initialLiked` and `initialLikeCount` props
- No server-side state fetching on component mount
- Optimistic updates not synced with server response
- Like state only stored in component local state (lost on unmount)

**Fix Applied:**
1. **Server state fetching:**
   - Added `useEffect` hook to fetch actual like state from `/api/feed/engagement` on mount
   - Updates local state with server data (`isLiked`, `likeCount`)
   - Handles loading state during fetch

2. **Response synchronization:**
   - After like/unlike API call, update state with server response
   - Use `data.likeCount` from API response instead of optimistic calculation
   - Ensure state matches server truth

3. **Error handling:**
   - Falls back to initial props if fetch fails
   - Reverts optimistic updates if API call fails

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/feed/EngagementBar.tsx`

**API Endpoint Used:**
- `GET /api/feed/engagement?itemId={id}&itemType={type}` (already existed, returns `isLiked` and `likeCount`)

**Verification:**
- Likes persist after page refresh
- Like counts accurate across different user sessions
- State syncs correctly between client and server
- Works for both trips and activities

---

### Additional Fixes

#### Email Delivery Confirmed
**Status:** ✅ WORKING (Spam Folder)  
**Impact:** LOW - Functional but needs deliverability improvement  
**Finding:** Emails are being sent successfully via Resend, but are going to spam/junk folder  
**Recommendation:** 
- For production: Verify domain in Resend dashboard and set up SPF/DKIM records
- For testing: Continue using `onboarding@resend.dev` (emails work but may go to spam)
- Add email deliverability best practices to production checklist

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/email.ts` (improved error logging and diagnostics)

---

  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  
  user User  @relation(...)
  trip Trip? @relation(...)
}
```

## 🐛 Production Testing Round 4 (Dec 18, 2025 - Evening)

### Critical Issue Found 🔴

#### Bug #12: OPENAI_API_KEY Not Set in Vercel Production
**Status:** 🔴 **BLOCKING** - Environment Variable Missing  
**Impact:** CRITICAL - AI chat completely non-functional  
**Root Cause:** `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is **not set** in Vercel production environment

**Evidence from Vercel Logs (Dec 18, 23:00:29 UTC):**
```json
{
  "level": "error",
  "context": "AI_CHAT",
  "err": {
    "message": "OPENAI_API_KEY not configured"
  },
  "hasEnvVar": false,
  "envVarLength": 0,
  "envVarPrefix": "none",
  "envVarType": "undefined",
  "nodeEnv": "production"
}
```

**Diagnosis:**
- Environment variable is `undefined` at runtime
- Variable either not set, or set for wrong environment (Preview/Development only)
- Code validation working correctly - properly detecting missing key

**Fix Required (Manual Action):**
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `outthegroupchat-travel-app`
3. Navigate to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Click **Add New**
5. **Key:** `OPENAI_API_KEY`
6. **Value:** Your OpenAI API key (starts with `sk-`)
7. **CRITICAL:** Select **Production** environment (or "All Environments")
8. Click **Save**
9. **Redeploy** the application:
   - Go to **Deployments** tab
   - Click **⋯** (three dots) on latest deployment
   - Select **Redeploy**

**Getting OpenAI API Key:**
1. Go to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in to your OpenAI account
3. Click **Create new secret key**
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)
5. Paste into Vercel (no spaces, no quotes)

**Verification Steps:**
After redeploying, test AI chat and check logs:
- Should see: `hasEnvVar: true`
- Should see: `envVarLength: > 0` (typically 51+ characters)
- Should see: `envVarPrefix: "sk-..."` (first 7 characters)
- AI chat should work without errors

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Setting variable only for Preview/Development, not Production
- ❌ Forgetting to redeploy after adding variable
- ❌ Using wrong variable name (must be exactly `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- ❌ Copying key with extra spaces, quotes, or newlines
- ❌ Setting in wrong Vercel project

**Note:** The code validation now checks for `sk-` prefix format, so any invalid key format will also be caught and logged.
