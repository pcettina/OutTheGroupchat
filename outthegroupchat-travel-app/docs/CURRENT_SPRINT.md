## 🔴 PRIORITY 0: Critical Bug Fixes

### Issue #1: Notifications Data Structure Mismatch
**Status:** ✅ Verified Working  
**File:** `src/app/notifications/page.tsx`  
**Impact:** Users see error when viewing notifications

**Problem:**
```typescript
// Frontend expects:
data?.notifications

// API returns:
{ success: true, data: { notifications: [...], unreadCount: 5 } }

// Should access:
data?.data?.notifications
```

**Resolution:** Code inspection revealed the notifications page already correctly accesses `result.data` (line 22) and properly destructures `data?.notifications` and `data?.unreadCount`. No fix was needed.

**Verified:**
- [x] Notifications page correctly accesses data path
- [x] Unread count reference is correct
- [x] Error boundary exists in the component

---

### Issue #2: Comments API - Trip Support Missing
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**File:** `src/app/api/feed/comments/route.ts`  
**Impact:** Users can't comment on trip posts

**Problem:** API only supports `itemType: 'activity'`, but feed has trip items.

**Completed:**
- [x] Add TripComment model to Prisma schema
- [x] Update comments API to handle `itemType: 'trip'`
- [x] Added TRIP_COMMENT notification type
- [x] Run database migration via Supabase SQL Editor (Dec 17)
- [ ] Test comment creation on trips

**Schema Added:**
```prisma
model TripComment {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  tripId    String
  userId    String
  text      String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  trip Trip @relation(fields: [tripId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@index([tripId])
  @@index([userId])
}
```

---

### Issue #3: Reactions API - Trip Support Missing
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**File:** `src/app/api/feed/engagement/route.ts`  
**Impact:** Users can't like trip posts

**Problem:** Uses SavedActivity model, no TripLike model exists.

**Completed:**
- [x] Add TripLike model to Prisma schema
- [x] Update engagement API to use TripLike for trips
- [x] Update like counts in feed API (GET handler)
- [x] Added TRIP_LIKE notification type
- [x] Run database migration via Supabase SQL Editor (Dec 17)

**Schema Added:**
```prisma
model TripLike {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  tripId    String
  userId    String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())

  trip Trip @relation(fields: [tripId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@unique([userId, tripId])
  @@index([tripId])
}
```

### Issue #4: Email Invitations Not Working
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**File:** `src/app/api/trips/[tripId]/invitations/route.ts`, `src/lib/email.ts`  
**Impact:** Can't invite members via email

**Problem:** Line 136 has TODO for email sending - not implemented.

**Completed:**

## 🔴 PRIORITY 0: Security Fixes

### Security Fix #1: In-Memory Rate Limiting
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**File:** `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` (new), `src/lib/ai/client.ts`

### Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. ~~Add `RESEND_API_KEY` to Vercel production environment~~ ✅ Done
2. ~~Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to Vercel production environment~~ ✅ Done
3. ~~Run full production test checklist~~ ✅ Done (Dec 17)
4. **Fix issues found in production** ← CURRENT
5. Push to git and redeploy
6. Prepare for beta launch

## 🔮 Future Development Notes

### Data Acquisition for Algorithm Building
**Priority:** Future Sprint  
**Description:** Implement data collection infrastructure for ML/algorithm development

**Requirements:**
1. **AI Chat Logging** - Store chat conversations with labels
   - Track user queries and AI responses
   - Tag conversation topics (destination, budget, activities, etc.)
   - Store user satisfaction signals (retry clicks, session length)

2. **Content Tagging System**
   - Auto-tag AI responses for content building
   - Categorize successful trip recommendations
   - Build destination knowledge base from interactions

3. **Analytics Events**
   - Track feature usage patterns
   - Monitor trip planning workflows
   - Identify popular destinations and activities

**Database Schema Additions Needed:**
```prisma
model AIConversation {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId    String
  tripId    String?
  messages  Json     // Array of {role, content, timestamp}
  tags      String[] // Auto-generated topic tags
  metadata  Json?    // Session data, user signals
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  
  user User  @relation(...)
  trip Trip? @relation(...)
}
```
