## Dependencies Added
- csv-parser: For processing survey data
- path: For handling file paths
- fs: For file system operations

## Future Enhancements Identified

### 1. Price Data Integration
- Ticketmaster API for event prices
- Google Places API for local costs
- SeatGeek API for sports events
- Eventbrite API for local events

### 2. Web Scraping Capabilities
- Airbnb prices
- Hotel rates
- Local restaurant costs
- Transportation costs

### 3. Additional Features Needed
- Caching system for API responses
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Error handling for external services
- Price averaging and normalization

## Known Issues
1. NaN values appearing in cost per person calculations
2. Need to implement proper error handling for missing data
3. Budget calculations need real-world data integration

## Next Steps
1. Obtain API keys for various services
2. Implement web scraping functionality
3. Add caching system
4. Enhance budget calculations with real-world data
5. Add proper error handling
6. Implement rate limiting for external API calls

## Technical Debt
1. Need to add proper TypeScript types
2. Should implement unit tests
3. Need to add input validation
4. Should add logging system
5. Need to implement proper error handling

## Notes for Next Session
1. Begin implementing API integrations
2. Set up proper environment variables
3. Add data validation
4. Implement caching system
5. Add proper logging

## Questions to Address
1. How to handle rate limiting for multiple APIs?
2. Best way to cache API responses?
3. How to handle API failures gracefully?
4. What's the best way to normalize prices across different sources?
5. How to handle currency conversions if needed?

## Conclusion
Made significant progress in setting up the core functionality. The system is now capable of processing survey data and generating basic trip plans. Next phase will focus on integrating real-world data sources to provide more accurate pricing and recommendations.
